The WAF node interacts with the Wallarm Cloud. To connect the WAF node to the Cloud, proceed with the following steps:

1. Make sure that your Wallarm account has the **Administrator** or **Deploy** role enabled and two-factor authentication disabled in Wallarm Console.
     
    You can check mentioned settings by navigating to the users list in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/settings/users) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/settings/users).

        sudo /usr/share/wallarm-common/addnode
        ```
    === "US Cloud"
        ``` bash
        sudo /usr/share/wallarm-common/addnode -H us1.api.wallarm.com
        ```
3. Input an email and password of you account in Wallarm Console.
4. Input the WAF node name or click Enter to use automatically generated name.
5. Open Wallarm Console â†’ **Node** section in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/nodes) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/nodes) and ensure a new WAF node is added to the list.
