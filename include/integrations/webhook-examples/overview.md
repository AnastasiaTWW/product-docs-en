Webhooks can be used as system log sources. The number of log sources depends on the system complexity: the more components in the system, the greater number of log sources and logs. The most common logging scheme in complex systems consists of the following components:

* Log collector: accepts logs from several sources and forwards logs to the SIEM system
* SIEM system: used to analyze logs and monitor the system status
