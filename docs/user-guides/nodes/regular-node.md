# Regular WAF nodes

Regular WAF node is used in Linux-based, Kubernetes sidecar and Docker-based deployments.

## Creating WAF node

Regular WAF node is created while setting up integration with the platform:

* [NGINX](../../admin-en/installation-nginx-en.md)
* [NGINX Plus](../../admin-en/installation-nginxplus-en.md)
* [Docker](../../admin-en/installation-docker-en.md)
* [Kubernetes sidecar container](../../admin-en/installation-guides/kubernetes/wallarm-sidecar-container.md)
* [Kong](../../admin-en/installation-kong-en.md)

If the integration is successfully finished, created WAF node will be displayed in the list of nodes in Wallarm UI.

## Viewing details of WAF node

Details of installed WAF node are displayed in the table and the card of each WAF node. To open the card, click an appropriate table record.

The following node properties and metrics are available:
