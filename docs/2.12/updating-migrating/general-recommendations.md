# Recommendations for a safe WAF node update process

This document describes recommendations and associated risks for a safe update of Wallarm WAF node up to 2.12.

## Common recommendations

* Carefully plan and monitor the WAF node update process. Estimated release dates for new versions of WAF nodes are published in the [WAF node versioning policy](versioning-policy.md).
* If your infrastructure has multiple WAF nodes installed, update them gradually. After updating the first WAF node, monitor the WAF node modules operation within a day and gradually update other WAF nodes if the first WAF node operates correctly.
* For the model with separated development and production environments, update the WAF node gradually. First, apply and test new version in non-production environments, then in production environments. Detailed recommendations are described in the [instructions for configuring WAF nodes for separated environments](../admin-en/configuration-guides/waf-in-separated-environments/configure-waf-in-separated-environments.md#gradual-rollout-of-new-waf-changes).
* Before updating the WAF node, set the WAF node filtering mode to `monitoring`. If all modules work correctly and there is no abnormal number of new false positives in the `monitoring` mode for a day, put the WAF node in the `block` mode.
* Update NGINX to the latest version available before applying WAF node updates. If your infrastructure needs to use a specific version of NGINX, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) to build a WAF module for a custom version of NGINX.

## Possible risks

Below are the risks that may occur when updating the WAF node. To reduce the impact of the risks, please follow the appropriate guidelines when updating.

### Changed functionality

A new minor version of the WAF node may contain the following changes:

* Support for new installation options
* Dropped support for unclaimed installation options
* New WAF node features
* Optimization of work of the WAF node

The configuration of the previous version is automatically applied to the new version and does not require additional changes. When updating the cloud image, you should manually transfer the configuration files to the new version. Most of the new features are configured via the directives in configuration files.

Before upgrading, please check the [set of changes](what-is-new.md) and consider a possible configuration change in planning the upgrade.

??? "Set of changes in WAF node 2.12"
    **Supported installation options**

    * Deleted custom NGINX Build with Embedded Wallarm Module. Now only a dynamic module for NGINX is supported.
    * Installation of WAF node in Kubernetes is available:
        * [Installing NGINX Ingress Controller with Integrated Wallarm Services](../admin-en/installation-kubernetes-en.md)	
        * [Installing NGINX Plus Ingress Controller with Integrated Wallarm Services](../admin-en/installation-guides/ingress-plus/introduction.md)	
        * [Installing Wallarm Sidecar Container](../admin-en/installation-guides/kubernetes/wallarm-sidecar-container.md)

    **New WAF node features**

    * Attack grouping added.
    * URL encoding recognition added to the htmljs parser.
    * The possibility to limit request data processing iteration time added.
    * The `wallarm_request_chunk_size` directive that allows limiting the number of bytes to be processed in one request parameter added.
    * The informational pages about blocking added.
    * The `time_tnt` parameter was removed from the displayed node statistics.
    * The information about the data on whether the query is received completely added.
    * The assessment of the `time_detect` parameter in the filter node statistics fixed.
    * New WAF node statistics parameters are added: `stalled_workers_count` and `stalled_workers`.
    * Support for the new format of serialized requests in the wallarm-tarantool version 1.11.0 or higher. Before updating to 2.12, ensure that wallarm-tarantool version 1.11.0 or higher is already installed.

    **Optimization of work of the WAF node**

    * Query processing- and system resilience-related improvements were made.

### New false positives

We improve the traffic analysis with each new version of the WAF node, it means that the number of false positives decreases. However each protected application has its own specificities, so we recommend analyzing the work of the new version of the WAF node in the `monitoring` mode before enabling the blocking mode (`block`).

To analyze the number of new false positives after the update:

1. Deploy the new version of the WAF node in the `monitoring` [mode](../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md) and send the traffic to the WAF node.
2. After some time, open Wallarm Console â†’ **Events** section and analyze the number of requests that are mistakenly recognized as attacks.
3. If you find abnormal growth in the number of false positives, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com).

### Increased amount of used resources

Usage of some new WAF node features may cause changes in the amount of used resources. Information about changes in the amount of used resources is highlighted in the [What is new](what-is-new.md) section.

Also, it is recommended to monitor the WAF node operation: if you find significant differences in the actual amount of used resources and in the amount specified in the documentation, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com).

## Update process

The WAF node update process depends on the platform and installation forms. Please select the installation form and follow the appropriate instructions:

* [Modules for NGINX, NGINX Plus, Kong](nginx-modules.md)
* [Docker container with the modules for NGINX](docker-container.md)
